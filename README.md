# 🐞 TeaCode1122 – Debug Me Series

Welcome to the **TeaCode1122 Debug Me!** series — a hands-on, real-world DevOps challenge initiative by the **TeaCode1122 Community** 👑

Every week, we simulate a real problem faced in DevOps, Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, or Cloud.  
Your task is to **debug**, **explain**, and **fix** it. Learn by solving real errors, just like you would on the job!
